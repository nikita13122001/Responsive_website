        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits. There are many debates about its precise definition, for example, about which aims it tries to achieve. A further issue is whether part of the meaning of education is that the change in the student is an improvement. Some researchers stress the role of critical thinking to distinguish education from indoctrination. These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of education. The term can also refer to the mental states and qualities of educated people. Additionally, it can mean the academic field studying education.There are many types of education. Formal education happens in a complex institutional framework, like public schools. Non-formal education is also structured but happens outside the formal schooling system. Informal education is unstructured learning through daily experiences. Formal and non-formal education are divided into levels. They include early childhood education, primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on the teaching method, like teacher-centered and student-centered education. Forms of education can also be distinguished by subject, like science education, language education, and physical education.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">The healthy effects of Education</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education socializes children into society by teaching cultural values and norms. It equips them with the skills needed to become productive members of society. This way, it stimulates economic growth and raises awareness of local and global problems. Organized institutions affect many aspects of education. For example, governments set education policies. They determine when school classes happen, what is taught, and who can or must attend. International organizations, like UNESCO, have been influential in promoting primary education for all children.

            Many factors influence whether education is successful. Psychological factors include motivation, intelligence, and personality. Social factors, like socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and gender, are often linked to discrimination. Further factors include educational technology, teacher quality, and parent involvement.The main field investigating education is called education studies. It examines what education is and what aims it has. It also studies how it happens, what effects it has, and how to improve it. It has many subfields, like philosophy of education, psychology of education, sociology of education, economics of education, and comparative education. It also discusses the history of education. In prehistory, education happened informally through oral communication and imitation. With the rise of ancient civilizations, writing was invented, and the amount of knowledge grew. This caused a shift from informal to formal education. Initially, formal education was mainly available to elites and religious groups. The invention of the printing press in the 15th century made books more widely available. This increased general literacy. Beginning in the 18th and 19th centuries, public education became more important. It led to the worldwide process of making primary education available to all, free of charge, and compulsory up to a certain age.

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">The real meaning of Education</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> The definition of education has been explored by theorists from various fields.[1][2][3] Many agree that education is a purposeful activity aimed at achieving certain goals, which include the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits.[4][1][5] However, there is extensive debate regarding its exact nature beyond these general features. Some theorists view education primarily as a process that occurs during educational events such as schooling, teaching, and learning.[6][7][2] Others perceive it not as a process but as the product resulting from this process, emphasizing the mental states and dispositions of educated persons.[6][7][2] Additionally, the term may also refer to an academic field that studies the methods, processes, and social institutions involved in teaching and learning.[7] The term "education" is derived from the Latin words educare, meaning "bring up, rear, educate", primarily related to the mind, and educere, meaning "bring out, lead forth", and refers to the bodily level.[8]

            Some theorists provide precise definitions by identifying the specific features that are exclusive to all forms of education. R. S. Peters, for instance, outlines three essential features for education.Such precise definitions often succeed at characterizing the most typical forms of education. But they are criticized because there are counterexamples.[10][11][2] These difficulties have led some theorists to develop less precise concepts. Some of them are based on family resemblance. This means that all the forms of education are similar to each other. But they need not share a set of essential features that all of them have in common.[1][12][13] Some theorists claim that the term "education" is context-dependent. This implies that its meaning varies depending on the situation in which it is used.[2] Having a clear idea of what the term means is important to correctly identify forms of education. It also matters when trying to measure or improve them.
